# Hi, I'm Raúl González

Software Engineer building whatever I feel like building | Aspiring Founder | SysAdmin | CS Student @ UANL

I'm a Computer Science student at UANL passionate about creating practical solutions with AI and low-level systems. Currently building **Testly**, an AI-driven learning platform that transforms books and PDFs into structured, interactive lessons.

I am excited to show the outcome ASAP.

## What I'm Building

**Clank Framework** (Active Development)  
A modular desktop agent automation framework with a two-node architecture and internal communication protocol.
- Standardized and extensible communication protocol between general agent/state and plugins/modules
- Type-safe execution engine with Pydantic validating state, plans, and context at each step
- Designed to add almost any functionality easily, significantly reducing agent feature integration time
- Tech: LangGraph, Pydantic

**Testly** (Active Development)  
An AI-powered learning platform that converts books and PDFs into structured lessons and interactive learning flows.
- Agent workflows for document analysis, error handling, and iterative reasoning
- Tech: LangGraph

My focus is building products that solve real problems in whatever I can put my hands on.

## Featured Projects

**[Socrat-AI](https://github.com/raulgooo/socrat-ai)** — Academic Tutor Agent (Technical Test for Itierra)  

**[Nexus API](https://github.com/raulgooo/nexus-api)** — University Data Access API  
Open-source API enabling students to build productivity tools using university portal data.
- Reverse-engineered private endpoints for authenticated access
- Powers student-built applications for deadline tracking and schedule management

**HTTP Server from Scratch**  
Minimal HTTP server implementation using only Linux syscalls and standard libraries.

**POSIX/Unix Shell**  
Functional command shell for Linux/UNIX-based systems using basic libraries.
- Implemented core shell functionality in C

## Tech Stack

**Languages:** Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, C, SQL 
**Backend & Infrastructure:** FastAPI, Flask, Docker, AsyncIO, SQLite, REST APIs  
**Tools & Automation:** Playwright, PyAutoGUI, OAGI, Git, PostMan
